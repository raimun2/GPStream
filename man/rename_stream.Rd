\title{Rename GPS streams according to convention long, lat, elev, timestamp and time. If variable time is missing, the algorithm will aggregate a variable 'time' defined as seconds from start.
The algorithm identify some typical names for longitude, latitude, elevation and time. Then raname variables, order it and return a dataframe. If some of this variables is missing or dosen't have a typical name, the return will only have renamed entry variables.}
\usage{
rename_stream(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is a dataframe or tibble containing a GPS stream. The stream dataframe can be obtained from rStrva library.(see rStrava documentation)

rename_stream()}
}
\value{
dataframe stream with 'lon', 'lat', 'ele' and 'time' variables.
